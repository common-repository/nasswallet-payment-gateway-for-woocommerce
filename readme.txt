Accept payments on your WooCommerce store with NassWallet Payment Gateway.

== Description ==
NassWallet for WooCommerce is developed to accept payments through NassWallet payment gateway from WooCommerce stores.

By default, NassWallet payment gateway accepts only IQD as currency unit. However, you can enable Multi currency Support Option from the plugin settings in order to accept payments in different Currencies. For that you need to set an accurate exchange and up to date rate against IQD in which the plugin will use to calculate and change the order amount to IQD. It will be the merchant's responsiblity to set an accurate exchange rate against the IQD. The developer is not responsible for setting incorrect or outdated rates.

In case of the failure payments, by default we will redirect the customer to the main home page. In order to change this behavior, you can set the redirection URL option from the settings with the full page URL that you want the user to redirect to it.

The customer will be redirected to the checkout page for Successful payments.
